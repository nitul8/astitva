                    As part of our commitment to humanitarian efforts, we are
                    organizing a Food Distribution Drive to provide nutritious
                    meals to those in need. Aiming to serve 100-150
                    underprivileged individuals, ensuring that they receive a
                    warm and fulfilling meal.

                    As per the Global Hunger Index, India ranks 103rd out of 119
                    countries, indicating a serious level of hunger. Not
                    everyone realizes their role, but you can make a difference
                    through donation, volunteering, or raising awareness.
