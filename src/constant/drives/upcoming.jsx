                Join us in our mission to break the stigma surrounding
                menstruation! Our Menstrual Hygiene Drive aims to spread
                awareness, educate individuals about menstrual health, and
                ensure access to essential sanitary products. Through this
                initiative, we will be donating 200+ sanitary pads and hosting
                an informative session on menstrual hygiene and sex education.
                <br />

                Let's come together to empower lives, foster open conversations,
                and create a more inclusive and informed society. Stay tuned for
                the event details!
