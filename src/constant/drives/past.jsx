                    Generous individuals from our community came forward to
                    donate clothes, extending a helping hand to those in need.
                    Our team organized a collection drive on 22nd January 2025,
                    where we gathered a significant number of warm clothes,
                    ensuring they reached people who required them the most
                    during the cold season.

                <p>
                    On 23rd January 2025, we successfully distributed the
                    collected clothes to underprivileged individuals, including
                    homeless people and families facing hardships. Seeing the
                    smiles on their faces and the gratitude in their eyes was
                    truly heartwarming. This initiative not only provided warmth
                    but also reinforced the spirit of compassion and community
                    support.

                    Our Pawlentine Drive was a special initiative dedicated to
                    spreading love and care to our furry friends. On 16th
                    February 2025, we organized a vaccination and feeding drive
                    for stray dogs and cats in Jorhat. Our team collaborated
                    with Rajib Chakraborty Sir, local veterinarian Dr Laaraa
                    Ma'am and Nu Animal Walfare Foundation to provide essential
                    vaccinations and medical care to these animals.

                <p>
                    In addition to medical assistance, we distributed food and
                    water to the stray dogs, ensuring they received proper
                    nutrition and hydration. This drive aimed to promote animal
                    welfare and create a safer and healthier environment for
                    both animals and humans in the community.
