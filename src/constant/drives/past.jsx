                Join us in our mission to break the stigma surrounding
                menstruation! Our Menstrual Hygiene Drive aims to spread
                awareness, educate individuals about menstrual health, and
                ensure access to essential sanitary products. Through this
                initiative, we will be donating 200+ sanitary pads and hosting
                an informative session on menstrual hygiene and sex education.
                <br />
                <br />
                Let&apos;s come together to empower lives, foster open
                conversations, and create a more inclusive and informed society.
                Stay tuned for the event details!

                    supporting underprivileged individuals and families facing
                    food insecurity. On March 9, 2025, we organized a meal

                    reached those in need.

                    Our Pawlentine Drive was a special initiative dedicated to
                    spreading love and care to our furry friends. On 16th
                    February 2025, we organized a vaccination and feeding drive
                    for stray dogs and cats in Jorhat. Our team collaborated
                    with Rajib Chakraborty Sir, local veterinarian Dr Laaraa
                    Ma'am and Nu Animal Walfare Foundation to provide essential
                    vaccinations and medical care to these animals.

                    In addition to medical assistance, we distributed food and
                    water to the stray dogs, ensuring they received proper
                    nutrition and hydration. This drive aimed to promote animal
                    welfare and create a safer and healthier environment for
                    both animals and humans in the community.

                    donate clothes, extending a helping hand to those in need.
                    Our team organized a collection drive on 22nd January 2025,

                    homeless people and families facing hardships. Seeing the
                    smiles on their faces and the gratitude in their eyes was
                    truly heartwarming. This initiative not only provided warmth
